Compile hello.f90/hello.c
Create a pbs script to submit a job
to run the executable

Compile and run the hybrid program
using npersocket option to launch
one mpi process per cpu with 8 openmp
threads each.

Is it possible that OMP_NUM_THREADS is 
set differently on the mother node vs others?
Can you create such a scenario in an interactive
job?
